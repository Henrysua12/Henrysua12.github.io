                <h3>Interests</h3>
                <p>I have a couple of interests in the fields of computer science mainly software engineering, game design, app development and cyber security. However, I’m open to all fields as I do love to learn and try new things. As I mentioned before I truly love to learn, I enjoy being taught and then using what I’ve learned to build my own things or solve problems.</p>

                <h3>Hobbies</h3>
                <p>Two of my favorite hobbies I’d like to share are photography and language learning. It started back in highschool, at first it was just a few pictures of friends, but it eventually developed into professional portraits and landscape images. It also led me into using programs such as Adobe lightroom and photoshop. Language learning came about after visiting my home country I realized how important it was to be able to communicate with people in a language they’re familiar with which is why I tasked myself with learning a 3rd language, (Portuguese) and so far, it’s been fun!</p>

                <h3>Skills/Abilities</h3>
                <p>My main languages that I have been using are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and C++. As for relevant class work, I’ve taken Data structures and Discrete math. As well as experince in Adobe Lightroom and Adobe Photoshop I am fluent in Spanish and a beginner in Portuguese. I’m adept, eager to learn, a problem solver, creative and organized.</p>

        <div class="about-me__body">
            <p>As you’ve probably read from the title, my name is Henry Suarez. I am first generation Latino looking to break into tech. Both my parents are originally from Ecuador however, I was born here and mixed with both cultures. I’ve always had an interest in technology because as long as I can remember I was always amazed on how it can improve people’s live and quite literally provide someone the world in a 6-inch phone screen or in a 13-inch laptop screen. </p>
